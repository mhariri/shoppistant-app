Shoppistant App
=====================

Alaways have your receipts just one click away! Organize, search and even re-print your receipts.

## How to run?

You'll need [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) to build and run the app.

To run the app on your iPhone, use:

```bash
$ cordova platform add ios

For Android, replace ios in the command above with 'android'.
